# Multiplayer Dice Game
 A Dice Game made in Java for a school project, it allows multiple players to play a Dice game.
 This was finished in BlueJ but I also included the version I made in Eclipse to test and do things but it's missing some stuff compared to the final BlueJ version I sent to my teacher 
 PS: I also want to leave a note that I hated working with BlueJ and I hope this was the only time...
